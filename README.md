## Safecoind
This software is Safecoin client, generally you will use this if you want to mine SAFE or setup a full node.
It downloads and stores the entire history of Safecoin transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the blockchain has reached a significant size.
## Development Resources

-Bare with us as this brand new coin rapidly develops!

## List of Safecoin Platform Technologies
Proof of Work (PoW), with planned ability for dPOW - Additional security layer.
zk-SNARKs - Safecoin Platformï¿½s privacy technology
Jumblr - Decentralized tumbler for SAFE and other cryptocurrencies
Assetchains - Easy way to fork Safecoin coin
Pegged Assets - Chains that maintain a peg to fiat currencies
Peerchains - Scalability solution where sibling chains form a network of blockchains


## Tech Specification
Max Supply: 36 million SAFE.
Block Time: 1M 2s
Block Reward: 128 SAFE Halving every 86 days for just under 2 years
Mining Algorithm: Equihash
## About this Project
Safecoin is a fork of the Komodo and Zcash projects, although we have made significant changes and continue to evolve in our own direction.
Same Zcash is based on Bitcoin's code, with difference Zcash intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are available in our [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/zcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf).
## Getting started
Dependencies
------------

```
#The following packages are needed:
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-openssl-dev bsdmainutils automake curl
```

```
git clone https://github.com/Fair-Exchange/safecoin
cd safecoin
#you might want to: git checkout <branch>; git pull
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 uses 8 threads - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```

# to update an existing version, git checkout dPoW if not on that branch already
git pull
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
To reset the blockchain, from ~/.safecoin rm -rf blocks chainstate debug.log safecoinstate db.log
Create safecoin.conf
------------------

```
cd ~
mkdir .safecoin
cd .safecoin
pico safecoin.conf
#Add the following lines to the safecoin.conf file:
#rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
#rpcpassword=password
txindex=1
addnode=107.191.36.192
addnode=45.77.109.253
```

Start mining
------------

```
#iguana documentation shows how to get the btcpubkey and wifstrs that need to be used
#bitcoin also need to be installed with txindex=1 and with rpc enabled
cd ~
cd safecoin
#This will return your pubkey eg. "0259e137e5594cf8287195d13aed816af75bd5c04ae673296b51f66e7e8346e8d8" for your address
./src/safecoin-cli validateaddress <yourwalletaddres>
#This will give the privkey of your wallet address
./src/safecoin-cli dumpprivkey <yourwalletaddres>
#This will import the privkey to be sure the mined coins are placed into your wallet address
./src/safecoin-cli importprivkey <yourwalletprivkey>
#To stop the daemon:
./src/safecoin-cli stop
#This starts safecoin notary - replace genproclimit with number of threads you want to use and add your pubkey
./src/safecoind -gen -genproclimit=2 -notary -pubkey="0259e137e5594cf8287195d13aed816af75bd5c04ae673296b51f66e7e8346e8d8" &
#This will get the stats:
./src/safecoin-cli getinfo
#To view the process:
ps -ef | grep safecoind
#To stop the daemon:
./src/safecoin-cli stop

#To view safecoind output:
tail -f ~/.safecoin/debug.log
#To view all command
./src/safecoin-cli help
ASSETCHAINS: -ac_name=name -ac_supply=nnnnn
Both safecoind and safecoin-cli recognize -ac_name=option so you can create fork from the commandline
```

There is a small chance that an outbound transaction will give an error due to mismatched values in wallet calculations. There is a -exchange option that you can run safecoind with, but make sure to have the entire transaction history under the same -exchange mode. Otherwise you will get wallet conflicts.
To change modes:
a) backup all privkeys (launch safecoind with -exportdir=<path> and dumpwallet)
b) start a totally new sync including wallet.dat, launch with same exportdir
c) stop it before it gets too far and import all the privkeys from a) using safecoin-cli importwallet filename
d) resume sync till it gets to chaintip
For example:
./safecoind -exportdir=/tmp &
./safecoin-cli dumpwallet example
./safecoin-cli stop
mv ~/.safecoin ~/.safecoin.old && mkdir ~/.safecoin && cp ~/.safecoin.old/safecoin.conf ~/.safecoin.old/peers.dat ~/.safecoin
./safecoind -exchange -exportdir=/tmp &
./safecoin-cli importwallet /tmp/example
############## JUMBLR
safecoind now has jumblr_deposit and jumblr_secret RPC calls.
Jumblr works like described previously where all the nodes with jumblr active synchronize their tx activity during the same block to maximize the mixing effect. However, unlike all other mixers/tumblers, you never give up control of your coins to anybody else. JUMBLR uses a one to many allocation of funds, ie. one deposit address and many secret addresses. You can always run multiple safecoind daemons to get multiple active deposit addresses.
JUMBLR implements t -> z, z -> z and z -> t transactions to maximize privacy of the destination t (transparent) address. So while it is transparent, its first activity is funds coming from an untracable z address.
Which of the three stages is done is randomly selected at each turn. Also when there is more than one possible transaction at the selected stage, a random one is selected. This randomization prevents analyzing incoming z ->t transactions by its size to correlate it to the originating address.
jumblr_deposit <depositaddr> designates the deposit address as the jumblr deposit address for that session. You can select an address that already has funds in it and it will immediately start jumblr process. If there are no funds, it will wait until you send funds to it.
There are three sizes of a jumblr transaction: 10 SAFE, 100 SAFE and 1000 SAFE. There is also a fixed interval of blocks where all jumblr nodes are active. Currently it is set to be 10, but this is subject to change. Only during every 10*10 blocks are the largest 1000 SAFE transactions processed, so this concentrates all the large transactions every N*N blocks.
jumblr_secret <secretaddress> notifies JUMBLR where to send the final z -> t transactions. In order to allow larger accounts to obtain privacy, up to 777 secret addresses are supported. Whenever a z -> t stage is activated, a random secret address from the list of the then active secret addresses is selected.
Practical Advice:
Obtaining privacy used to be very difficult. JUMBLR makes it as simple as issuing two command line calls. Higher level layers can be added to help manage the addresses, ie. linking them at the passphrase level. Such matters are left to each implementation.
Once obtained, it is very easy to lose all the privacy. With a single errant transaction that combines some previously used address and the secretaddress, well, the secretaddress is no longer so private.
The advice is to setup a totally separate node!
This might seem a bit drastic, but if you want to maintain privacy, it is best to make it look like all the transactions are coming from a different node. The easiest way for most people to do this is to actually have a different node.
It can be a dedicated laptop (recommended) or a VPS (for smaller amounts) with a totally fresh safecoind wallet. Generate an address on this wallet and use that as the jumblr_secret address on your main node. As the JUMBLR operates funds will teleport into your secret node's address. If you are careful and never use the same IP address for both your nodes, you will be able to maintain very good privacy.
Of course, don't send emails that link the two accounts together! Dont use secret address funds for home delivery purchases! Etc. There are many ways to lose the privacy, just think about what linkages can be dont at the IP and blockchain level and that should be a useful preparation.
What if you have 100,000 SAFE and you dont want others to know you are such a whale?
Instead of generating 1 secret address, generate 100 and make a script file with:
./safecoin-cli jumblr_secret <addr0>
./safecoin-cli jumblr_secret <addr1>
...
./safecoin-cli jumblr_secret <addr99>
And make sure to delete all traces of this when the JUMBLR is finished. You will end up with 100 addresses that have an average of 1000 SAFE each. So as long as you are careful and dont do a 10,000 SAFE transaction (that will link 10 of your secret addresses together), you can appear as 100 different people each with 1000 SAFE.
